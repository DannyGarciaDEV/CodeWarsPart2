// DESCRIPTION:
// Create a function that takes a Roman numeral as its argument and returns its value as a numeric decimal integer. You don't need to validate the form of the Roman numeral.

// Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each decimal digit of the number to be encoded separately, starting with the leftmost digit and skipping any 0s. So 1990 is rendered "MCMXC" (1000 = M, 900 = CM, 90 = XC) and 2008 is rendered "MMVIII" (2000 = MM, 8 = VIII). The Roman numeral for 1666, "MDCLXVI", uses each letter in descending order.

// Example:

// solution('XXI'); // should return 21


function solution(roman) {
    const romanValues = {
      I: 1,
      V: 5,
      X: 10,
      L: 50,
      C: 100,
      D: 500,
      M: 1000
    };
    
    let result = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < roman.length; i++) {
      const current = romanValues[roman[i]];
      const next = romanValues[roman[i + 1]];
      
      if (next && current < next) {
        result += next - current;
        i++;
      } else {
        result += current;
      }
    }
    
    return result;
  }
  
//   Multiples of 3 or 5

//   If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

//   Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).
  
//   Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.
  
  

  function solution(number) {
    if (number <= 0) {
      return 0;
    }
  
    let sum = 0;
  
    for (let i = 3; i < number; i++) {
      if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) {
        sum += i;
      }
    }
  
    return sum;
  }


//   Create Phone Number
//   Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

//   Example
//   createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"


// Two Sum
// Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: (index1, index2).

// For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.

// The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).

// Based on: http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
let nums = [3, 3];
let target = 6;

const twoSum = (nums, target) => {
  for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
    for(let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++){
      if(nums[i] + nums[j] === target){
        return [i, j]
      }
    }
  }
  return null;
} 
twoSum(nums, target)

//6ku





function createPhoneNumber(numbers) {
    if (numbers.length !== 10) {
      return "Invalid input. Please provide an array of 10 integers.";
    }
  
    const areaCode = numbers.slice(0, 3).join('');
    const firstPart = numbers.slice(3, 6).join('');
    const secondPart = numbers.slice(6).join('');
  
    return `(${areaCode}) ${firstPart}-${secondPart}`;
  }

Financing Plan on Planet XY140Z-n

I need to save some money to buy a gift. I think I can do something like that:

First week (W0) I save nothing on Sunday, 1 on Monday, 2 on Tuesday... 6 on Saturday, second week (W1) 2 on Monday... 7 on Saturday and so on according to the table below where the days are numbered from 0 to 6.

Can you tell me how much I will have for my gift on Saturday evening after I have saved 12? (Your function finance(6) should return 168 which is the sum of the savings in the table).

Imagine now that we live on planet XY140Z-n where the days of the week are numbered from 0 to n (integer n > 0) and where I save from week number 0 to week number n included (in the table below n = 6).

How much money would I have at the end of my financing plan on planet XY140Z-n?
