# Why would we want to stop to only 50 shades of grey? Let's see to how many we can go.

# Write a function that takes a number n as a parameter and return an array containing n shades of grey in hexadecimal code (#aaaaaa for example). The array should be sorted in ascending order starting with '#010101', '#020202', etc. (using lower case letters).

# Examples:

# n =  1:    ["#010101"]
# n = 10:    ["#010101", "#020202", "#030303", "#040404", "#050505", "#060606", "#070707", "#080808", "#090909", "#0a0a0a"]
